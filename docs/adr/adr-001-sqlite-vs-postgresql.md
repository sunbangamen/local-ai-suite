# ADR-001: Choose SQLite over PostgreSQL for RBAC Security Database

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Decision Makers**: Development Team
**Related Issue**: #8 - MCP 보안 강화

---

## Context

We need to implement a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with audit logging for 18 MCP tools. The system requires:

1. **User-Role-Permission mapping** (RBAC schema)
2. **Audit logging** for all tool invocations
3. **Concurrent access support** (multiple readers, single writer)
4. **Performance targets**:
   - RBAC permission check: <10ms (p95)
   - Audit logging: <5ms (async, non-blocking)
   - Total request overhead: <500ms (p95)

The key architectural decision is choosing between **SQLite** and **PostgreSQL** as the security database.

---

## Decision

**We will use SQLite with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode as the security database.**

---

## Rationale

### Option 1: SQLite (✅ Chosen)

#### Advantages

1. **Zero Configuration**
   - No separate database server to deploy/manage
   - Single file database (`/mnt/e/ai-data/sqlite/security.db`)
   - Already using SQLite for AI Analytics DB

2. **Performance for Our Use Case**
   - Embedded database with no network overhead
   - Excellent for read-heavy workloads (RBAC permission checks)
   - WAL mode enables concurrent readers + single writer
   - Benchmarks show <5ms SELECT queries for RBAC lookups

3. **Simplicity & Maintenance**
   - No connection pooling complexity
   - No authentication/authorization overhead
   - Backup = file copy
   - Recovery = replace file
   - Perfect fit for single-instance MCP server

4. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Minimal memory footprint (~1MB for cache)
   - No separate process overhead
   - Ideal for external SSD deployment

5. **Migration Path**
   - Can migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed
   - Schema is database-agnostic (standard SQL)
   - Migration script easily implementable

#### Disadvantages

1. **Concurrent Write Limitations**
   - WAL mode allows only **one writer at a time**
   - Multiple writers queue and retry
   - Acceptable for current single-instance architecture

2. **Scalability Ceiling**
   - Not suitable for distributed systems (multiple MCP servers)
   - Maximum ~10,000 requests/second (far exceeds our needs)
   - Current load: ~10-100 requests/second

3. **Feature Limitations**
   - No built-in replication
   - No advanced query optimization
   - No stored procedures
   - **None of these are needed for RBAC use case**

#### Mitigation Strategies for Disadvantages

1. **Concurrent Writes**:
   - Use async audit logging with queue (reduces write contention)
   - Batch insert for audit logs (10-50 entries per transaction)
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff

2. **Scalability**:
   - Monitor request rates
   - If exceeding 1,000 req/s, trigger PostgreSQL migration
   - Feature flag: `MIGRATE_TO_POSTGRES=true`

3. **Backup & Recovery**:
   - Daily backup script with WAL checkpoint
   - Test restore procedure quarterly
   - Keep 7-day backup retention

### Option 2: PostgreSQL (❌ Not Chosen)

#### Advantages

1. **Scalability**
   - Supports multiple writers concurrently
   - Horizontal scaling with replication
   - Suitable for distributed systems

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Row-level locking
   - Advanced indexing (GIN, GiST)
   - Stored procedures for complex logic
   - Full ACID compliance

3. **Production Maturity**
   - Battle-tested at enterprise scale
   - Rich ecosystem of tools (pgAdmin, pg_dump)
   - Excellent monitoring/metrics

#### Disadvantages

1. **Operational Complexity** 🚨
   - Requires separate Docker container
   - Database initialization/migration scripts
   - User/permission management
   - Connection pooling configuration
   - Network latency (container-to-container)

2. **Resource Overhead**
   - PostgreSQL container: ~50MB memory baseline
   - Connection pooling: ~10MB per connection
   - Network round-trip: +5-10ms latency

3. **Development Overhead**
   - Additional development time: 1-2 weeks
   - More complex testing (separate test DB)
   - CI/CD pipeline complexity

4. **Deployment Complexity**
   - Docker Compose orchestration
   - Health check dependencies
   - Startup ordering issues
   - External SSD path mapping

5. **Over-Engineering**
   - **Current reality**: Single MCP server instance
   - **Current load**: <100 requests/second
   - **Needed features**: Only basic CRUD + transactions
   - PostgreSQL capabilities far exceed requirements

#### When to Reconsider

PostgreSQL becomes viable when:
- Multiple MCP server instances (horizontal scaling)
- Request rate exceeds 1,000/second
- Distributed deployment across machines
- Advanced analytics requirements

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: SQLite Setup (Week 1)

```bash
# Directory structure
/mnt/e/ai-data/sqlite/
  ├── security.db         # Main database
  ├── security.db-wal     # WAL file
  └── security.db-shm     # Shared memory file

# Initialization
- Enable WAL mode: PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL
- Create 5 tables (users, roles, permissions, role_permissions, audit_logs)
- Create indexes for performance
- Seed default roles/permissions
```

### Phase 2: Migration Path (If Needed)

```python
# Future PostgreSQL migration script
def migrate_sqlite_to_postgres():
    """
    1. Dump SQLite to SQL
    2. Transform schema (if needed)
    3. Import to PostgreSQL
    4. Verify data integrity
    5. Update connection string
    6. Test with feature flag
    """
    pass
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. ✅ **Faster Development**: 1-2 weeks saved vs PostgreSQL
2. ✅ **Lower Complexity**: No additional Docker services
3. ✅ **Better Performance**: No network latency
4. ✅ **Easier Testing**: In-memory SQLite for unit tests
5. ✅ **Simpler Deployment**: Single file database
6. ✅ **Cost Efficient**: No additional resource consumption

### Negative

1. ⚠️ **Scalability Ceiling**: Must migrate if traffic grows 10x
2. ⚠️ **Single Point of Failure**: No built-in replication
3. ⚠️ **Manual Backups**: No automated snapshot tools

### Neutral

1. ℹ️ **Migration Effort**: ~3-5 days if PostgreSQL needed later
2. ℹ️ **Monitoring**: Custom scripts vs native Postgres metrics
