- **Mitigation**: Tests include truncation validation

- **Issue**: Qdrant timeout under load
- **Mitigation**: Retry mechanism + exponential backoff tested

### Phase 2
- **Issue**: WSL2 display configuration
- **Mitigation**: Xvfb support documented, VNC fallback

- **Issue**: Selector flexibility across implementations
- **Mitigation**: Multiple selector options per element

### Phase 3/4
- **Issue**: GPU memory constraints (RTX 4050 6GB)
- **Mitigation**: Staged load testing (10→50→100)

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Phase 1 Execution Issues

# Tests won't run?
make down && make up-p2
sleep 10
make test-rag-integration-extended

# Coverage not measured?
docker compose -f docker/compose.p2.cpu.yml exec rag bash
cat /app/coverage.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Phase 2 Execution Issues
```bash
# Playwright installation failed?
cd desktop-app && npm install
npx playwright install chromium

# Tests hang in WSL2?
pkill -f "http.server"
npm run test:e2e
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Phase 1 Design Decisions
- **AsyncIO**: Used for concurrent HTTP calls (better than threads)
- **Fixtures**: Shared `seeded_environment` for test isolation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Tests handle 200/503 responses
- **Coverage Focus**: Prioritized uncovered lines first

### Phase 2 Design Decisions
- **Flexible Selectors**: Multiple options per element (better resilience)
- **WSL2 Optimization**: Explicit timeouts and display config
- **Multi-Browser**: Chromium/Firefox/WebKit for compatibility
- **Error Handling**: Both network and service errors covered
