---

## Step 2: Technical Investigation

### Code Analysis Results

**영향 범위 분석**:

**Backend Services**:
- `services/rag/app.py` (342 statements, 67% coverage) - Needs +8% via integration tests
- `services/rag/tests/integration/` - 6 existing tests, need expansion
- `services/embedding/app.py` (81% coverage) - Stable, no changes needed
- `services/mcp-server/app.py` - Subject of E2E testing

**Infrastructure**:
- `docker/compose.p2.cpu.yml` - Mock inference for CI integration tests
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Needs extension for new test phases
- `Makefile` - Needs new targets (test-rag-integration-extended, test-load, test-e2e)

**Testing Infrastructure** (Current State):
- **Total Tests**: 117 (RAG 22, Embedding 18, MCP 47, Integration 15, Memory 15)
- **Integration Tests**: 6 RAG integration tests (1.47s execution time)
- **E2E Tests**: 0 (needs 22 Playwright tests)
- **Load Tests**: 0 (needs Locust infrastructure)

**Desktop Application**:
- `desktop-app/` - Basic structure exists, needs E2E test coverage

**Blocks**: None (this is the final push to 100% production readiness)

**Related Issues**: None active

---

## Step 3: Solution Strategy

### Approach Options

**Option 1: Sequential Execution (Conservative)**
- **Phase 1** → **Phase 2** → **Phase 3** → **Phase 4** (strictly sequential)
- **장점**: Lower risk, clear milestones, easier debugging
- **단점**: 17 days total (1-person), slow progress
- **예상 시간**: 17일 (1인)
- **위험도**: Low

**Option 2: Parallel Execution (Aggressive)**
- **Engineer A** (Backend): Phase 1 + 3 + 4 (RAG, Load Tests, CI)
- **Engineer B** (Frontend): Phase 2 (E2E Playwright tests)
- **장점**: Fastest completion (15 working days 캘린더), resource efficient
- **단점**: Requires 2 engineers, coordination overhead
- **예상 시간**: 15일 (2인 병렬, 실 작업 73h → Engineer A ~42h / Engineer B ~31h)
- **위험도**: Medium

**Option 3: Phased Rollout with Early Wins (Pragmatic)**
- **Week 1**: Phase 1 (RAG 75%) + Phase 3.1-3.3 (Locust setup)
- **Week 2**: Phase 2 (E2E critical paths only, ~15 tests) + Phase 3.4-3.5 (Load testing)
- **Week 3**: Phase 4 (CI integration) + remaining E2E tests (~7 tests)
- **장점**: Early production readiness (RAG 75% + Load tests by Week 1), flexible scope
- **단점**: Partial E2E coverage initially
- **예상 시간**: 17-20일 (1인, flexible)
- **위험도**: Medium-Low

### Recommended Approach

**✅ Option 2: Parallel Execution (2-person team)**

**선택 이유**:
1. **Fastest ROI**: Reaches 100% production readiness in 15 days vs 17-20 days
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Backend/Infra vs Frontend/QA skillsets
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Independent work streams reduce blocking dependencies
4. **Resource Availability**: AI CLI and MCP tools can support both engineers simultaneously
5. **Codebase Structure**: Well-separated services enable parallel development

> **일정 가정**: Engineer A 약 42시간(5.5 근무일), Engineer B 약 31시간(4 근무일)을 투입합니다. 20% 버퍼는 공통으로 확보해 캘린더 상 3주(15 근무일)에 분산 배치하며, WSL2·GPU 변수와 CI 승인 절차를 마지막 주에 집중 흡수합니다.

**Alternative**: If only 1 engineer available, use **Option 3** for early wins strategy.

## Step 5: Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **WSL2 Playwright execution failure** | High | Medium | Use Docker container for Playwright, configure headless mode with VNC fallback, test on Ubuntu VM |
| **GPU server instability during load tests** | Medium | High | Implement staged load increases (10→50→100), monitor GPU memory with nvidia-smi, auto-restart on OOM |
| **RAG 75% target not achievable** | Medium | Low | Adjust target to 70-72% if integration complexity too high, prioritize high-value tests, refactor complex paths |
| **CI free tier budget exhaustion** | Low | High | Run E2E/load tests only on main branch and scheduled nightly, skip on PR commits, use self-hosted runner for GPU tests |
| **E2E test flakiness** | Medium | Medium | Use Playwright auto-retry (3 attempts), add explicit waits for async operations, implement test isolation |
| **Load test results not reproducible** | Medium | Medium | Document exact environment setup (Docker compose, GPU config), use fixed random seeds, average 3 test runs |

### Technical Challenges

**예상 기술적 난점**:

1. **PostgreSQL Integration in RAG Tests**
   - **Challenge**: Mocking complex SQLAlchemy operations while maintaining test speed
   - **Solution**: Use lightweight SQLite in-memory DB for unit tests, real Postgres for integration tests only

2. **Playwright WSL2 Configuration**
   - **Challenge**: Browser display issues in headless WSL2 environment
   - **Solution**: Use `DISPLAY` environment variable configuration, leverage Playwright's built-in WSL2 support, run in Docker container

3. **Load Test GPU Memory Management**
   - **Challenge**: GPU OOM errors under sustained high load (RTX 4050 6GB limit)
   - **Solution**: Monitor with `nvidia-smi`, implement automatic model unloading, use CPU fallback for code-7b during peak load

4. **CI/CD Execution Time**
   - **Challenge**: Full test suite (163 tests) may exceed 30-minute CI timeout
   - **Solution**: Matrix strategy for parallel test execution, skip slow tests on PR (run nightly only), use test result caching

### Rollback Plan

**롤백 시나리오**:

1. **RAG Integration Tests Fail in CI**
   - → Rollback to Phase 1 commit, debug locally in Docker, fix PostgreSQL connection issues

2. **E2E Tests Block Deployment**
   - → Disable E2E tests in CI temporarily, mark as "manual" in workflow, fix flaky tests offline

3. **Load Tests Crash GPU Server**
   - → Revert load test PR, restart Docker stack with `make down && make up-p2`, reduce concurrent users to 50 max

4. **CI Budget Exceeded**
   - → Disable nightly runs, reduce test matrix size, switch E2E/load tests to self-hosted runner

### Test Cases

**Phase 1: RAG Integration Tests (21 total)**

```gherkin
Feature: RAG Document Indexing with Real Database

  Scenario: Index documents with PostgreSQL persistence
    Given Phase 2 Docker stack is running
    And PostgreSQL database is seeded with test data
    When POST /index with collection "test-docs" and documents directory
    Then Documents are chunked and stored in Qdrant
    And Metadata is persisted in PostgreSQL collections table
    And Response status is 200 with chunk count

  Scenario: Query with LLM context injection
    Given Documents are already indexed in collection "test-docs"
    When POST /query with Korean query "Python 파일 읽기 방법"
    Then Qdrant retrieves top-3 relevant chunks via vector similarity
    And LLM receives chunks as context (max 1200 tokens)
    And LLM generates contextual answer in Korean
    And Response includes answer + source documents
    And Total latency is < 3 seconds

  Scenario: Qdrant timeout with retry logic
    Given Qdrant service is under heavy load
    When POST /query triggers Qdrant timeout
    Then RAG service retries 3 times with exponential backoff
    And If retries exhausted, return 503 with Retry-After header
    And Audit log records retry attempts
```

**Phase 2: E2E Playwright Tests (22 total)**

```gherkin
Feature: Desktop App Chat Interface

  Scenario: User sends message and receives AI response
    Given Desktop app is open at http://localhost:3000
    When User types "Hello world" in chat input
    And User clicks Send button (or presses Enter)
    Then Message appears in chat history with user avatar
    And Loading indicator appears while waiting
    And AI response appears within 5 seconds
    And Response includes markdown formatting

  Scenario: Model selection switches between Chat and Code models
    Given Desktop app is open in manual mode
    When User clicks model dropdown
    And User selects "Code Model (7B)"
    Then Model status indicator shows "code-7b"
    And Next message uses code model endpoint (port 8004)
    And Response prioritizes code-specific formatting

Feature: MCP Tool Integration

  Scenario: User executes Git status command via MCP
    Given Desktop app is open
    When User types "/mcp git_status" in chat input
    And User clicks Send
    Then MCP server receives execute request
    And Git status output appears in chat (formatted)
    And No errors occur (exit code 0)
```

**Phase 3: Locust Load Tests (3 scenarios)**

```python
# tests/load/locustfile.py

class APIGatewayUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 3)  # Random wait 1-3s between requests

    @task(3)  # Weight 3 (75% of requests)
    def chat_completion(self):
        self.client.post("/v1/chat/completions", json={
            "model": "chat-7b",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
        })

    @task(1)  # Weight 1 (25% of requests)
    def code_completion(self):
        self.client.post("/v1/chat/completions", json={
            "model": "code-7b",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "def fizzbuzz():"}]
        })

# Performance Targets:
# - 100 concurrent users: 95th percentile < 2s, error rate < 1%
# - Throughput: 50+ RPS sustained for 10 minutes
# - GPU memory: < 5.5GB (leave 0.5GB headroom)

## 📋 User Review Checklist

### Planning Review
- [x] **이슈 분석이 정확한가요?**
  - ✅ 핵심 요구사항 4개 파악 (RAG 75%, E2E 22 tests, Load testing, CI integration)
  - ✅ 기술적 제약사항 반영 (WSL2, GPU 6GB, CI budget, dependency on #20/#22/#23)

- [x] **선택한 해결 방안이 적절한가요?**
  - ✅ Option 2 (Parallel 2-person) 선택: 15일 vs 17일 (sequential)
  - ✅ Trade-off 합리적: 속도 우선, 팀 리소스 활용, 독립적 작업 영역

- [x] **구현 계획이 현실적인가요?**
  - ✅ Phase 1: 16h (2일) - RAG integration tests, 기존 pytest 경험 활용
  - ✅ Phase 2: 22h (3일) - Playwright E2E, WSL2 설정 포함
  - ✅ Phase 3: 22h (3일) - Locust setup + execution + optimization
  - ✅ Phase 4: 13h (2일) - CI extension, 기존 workflow 확장
  - ⚠️ **Dependency 순서**: Phase 1-3 병렬 가능, Phase 4는 모든 결과 필요

### Resource Review
- [x] **시간 추정이 합리적인가요?**
  - ✅ Total 73h active (15일 2인 병렬) + 20% buffer (3일)
  - ✅ 각 Task별 2-5시간 단위로 세분화되어 추적 가능
  - ⚠️ **Contingency**: WSL2 Playwright 설정에 +1일 추가 가능성

- [x] **필요한 리소스가 확보 가능한가요?**
  - ✅ Docker Phase 2 CPU stack 이미 구축 (compose.p2.cpu.yml)
  - ✅ GitHub Actions 워크플로우 기존 존재 (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  - ⚠️ **Self-hosted GPU runner**: Optional, CI budget 부족 시 필요
  - ⚠️ **Engineer B (Frontend/QA)**: 1인 작업 시 +5일 추가

### Risk Review
- [x] **위험 요소가 충분히 식별되었나요?**
  - ✅ 6개 High/Medium risk 식별 (WSL2, GPU OOM, CI budget, E2E flakiness 등)
  - ✅ 각 위험별 구체적 mitigation (Docker headless, staged load, test selection)
  - ⚠️ **추가 고려**: PostgreSQL 데이터 시딩 시간 (1회성 setup)

- [x] **롤백 계획이 현실적인가요?**
  - ✅ 각 Phase별 독립적 rollback 가능 (Git branch 분리)
  - ✅ CI 실패 시 임시 비활성화 옵션 제시
  - ✅ GPU 크래시 시 Docker 재시작 절차 명확

### Quality Review
- [x] **테스트 전략이 충분한가요?**
  - ✅ 4-level strategy: Unit (117) + Integration (+15) + E2E (22) + Load (3)
  - ✅ Coverage targets: RAG 75%, E2E critical paths 100%, performance baselines
  - ✅ Test cases documented (Gherkin + Python examples)
  - ⚠️ **Security testing**: Not in scope (already covered in Issue #18 RBAC)

## 💡 Recommendations

### Critical Success Factors

**Must-Have**:
1. ✅ **PostgreSQL Seed Data**: Create comprehensive seed data script for reproducible integration tests
2. ✅ **WSL2 Playwright Setup**: Allocate 4 hours for initial setup, use Docker fallback if needed
3. ✅ **CI Budget Monitoring**: Track GitHub Actions minutes weekly, switch to self-hosted if >70% used
4. ✅ **GPU Monitoring**: Use `nvidia-smi dmon` during load tests to catch OOM early

**Nice-to-Have**:
- **Self-Hosted GPU Runner**: Reduces CI costs, enables true GPU E2E tests (optional for Phase 4)
- **Test Result Dashboard**: Grafana dashboard for test metrics over time (optional post-Phase 4)
- **Performance Regression DB**: Store load test results in PostgreSQL for historical comparison

### Adjustments Based on Constraints

**If Only 1 Engineer Available**:
- Use **Option 3** (Phased Rollout with Early Wins)
- Priority order: Phase 1 (RAG 75%) → Phase 3.1-3.3 (Locust setup) → Phase 2 (15 E2E tests) → Phase 4
- Accept 15 E2E tests instead of 22 (focus on critical paths only)
- Total time: 20 days instead of 15 days

**If CI Budget Exhausted**:
- Run E2E tests manually on local WSL2 (not in CI)
- Run load tests only on release branches (not nightly)
- Use self-hosted runner for GPU-dependent tests
- Reduce test matrix parallelism (slower CI but lower cost)

**If RAG 75% Not Achievable**:
- Adjust target to 72% (5% gap instead of 8%)
- Focus on high-value integration paths (query + indexing)
- Document remaining gaps for future Issue #25 (optional)
