## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-20

### Added

  - `approval_required` field in 403 responses with metadata (`request_id`, `expires_at`, `status`)
  - Interactive CLI approval interface with `scripts/approval_cli.py`
  - Progress bar visualization for approval requests with automatic 1-second polling
  - Rich library fallback for environments without terminal support
  - Comprehensive approval workflow test coverage (8 test scenarios)

  - Approval request management endpoints with query capabilities
  - Request timeout and expiration handling with automatic cleanup
  - Audit logging integration for approval decisions (async queue-based)
  - Role-based approval access control via RBAC middleware

- **CI/CD Integration** (#20, #24)
  - GitHub Actions workflow with multi-stage testing (Lint → Security → Unit → Integration → Build)
  - Performance regression detection pipeline (4 automation scripts, 1,107 lines)
  - CPU-only test profile for CI environments (`docker/compose.p2.cpu.yml`)
  - Automated test execution via schedule (Sundays 2am UTC) and manual triggers

- **Performance Benchmarking** (#26, Phase 5, #24, Phase 3)
  - RBAC middleware performance: 80 RPS sustained, P95 latency 397ms (SQLite WAL mode)
  - API Gateway baseline: 28 requests/2min, latency 1-11ms (p95 < 650ms)
  - Progressive load testing: 28.49 RPS at 100 concurrent users (p95 < 2s target = 5-16ms actual)
  - Load test results stored in `tests/load/load_results_*.csv`

- **Operational Documentation** (#20, #24)
  - `docs/ops/MONITORING_GUIDE.md`: Grafana/Prometheus/Loki monitoring setup
  - `docs/ops/CI_CD_GUIDE.md`: GitHub Actions and local test execution
  - `docs/ops/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`: Production deployment procedures
  - `docs/scripts/REGRESSION_DETECTION_SCRIPTS.md`: Performance regression automation (489 lines)

- **Enhanced Test Coverage** (#22, #24)
  - RAG Service: 30 integration tests (67% code coverage, 342 statements)
  - Embedding Service: 18 tests (81% code coverage, 88 statements)
  - Extended RAG tests: 21 integration tests with cache/chunking/Korean text scenarios
  - API Gateway: 15 integration tests (baseline + extended health checks)

  - Memory Services: 15 tests (Qdrant failure handling + persistence)

### Changed

- **CLI User Experience** (#26, Phase 5)
  - Enhanced `scripts/ai.py` with Rich-based approval workflow visualization
  - Improved approval polling mechanism with automatic retry logic
  - Better error messaging for approval timeout scenarios
  - Graceful degradation when Rich library unavailable

- **RBAC Middleware Integration** (#26, Phase 5)
  - Middleware now creates approval requests automatically for HIGH/CRITICAL tools
  - Returns 403 response with metadata instead of immediate denial
  - Supports configurable approval timeout (default: 300 seconds)
  - Feature flag control: `APPROVAL_WORKFLOW_ENABLED` (default: True)

- **Dependencies**
  - Added: `rich>=13.0.0` (progress bar and UI visualization)
  - Verified: pytest>=7.0, tenacity>=8.0, httpx>=0.23.0
  - Updated: FastAPI health check implementations (all services)

### Fixed

- **Approval Workflow Metadata** (#26, Phase 5)
  - Fixed `_wait_for_approval()` return type to include metadata tuple `(bool, Dict[str, Any])`
  - Corrected conftest fixture to return new metadata format
  - Added timeout scenario with proper error code handling (`reason="create_failed"`)
  - Ensured metadata consistency across all approval request types

- **Phase 1 Planning Document Inconsistencies** (Issue #28, Phase 2-1)
  - Line 3: Updated from generic command reference to practical AI CLI examples
  - Line 69: Corrected file paths and added specific parameter validation requirements
  - Line 119: Changed from directory creation task to file review and adjustment

  - Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect Issue #26 completion and Phase 5 benchmarking
  - Synchronized README.md with new approval workflow capabilities
  - Added approval CLI usage examples to ops documentation

### Performance

- **RBAC Middleware Optimization**
  - SQLite WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode: 80 RPS sustained throughput
  - P95 latency: 397ms under concurrent load (meets 100ms+ design tolerance)
  - Connection pooling: Optimal throughput at 50 concurrent requests
  - Negligible overhead: <1ms per approval request with async audit logging

- **Approval Workflow Responsiveness**
  - 1-second polling interval for approval requests
  - Automatic cleanup of expired requests (300s default timeout)
  - Non-blocking async audit logging to database

- **Test Infrastructure**
  - GitHub Actions CI runtime: ~829 min/month budget (Phase 2: RAG=10min, E2E=8min, Load=15min per cycle)
  - Local test execution: RAG integration 6.06s, E2E 8-12s, Load baseline 2min
  - CPU-only CI profile: Avoids GPU timeouts in GitHub-hosted runners

### Testing

- **Integrated Test Coverage**: 144 Python unit/integration tests + 22 E2E Playwright tests
  - Phase 1: RAG Integration Tests executed (21/21 passed)
  - Phase 2: E2E Playwright Tests structured (22 scenarios ready for execution)
  - Phase 3: Load Testing completed (baseline + progressive, baseline CSV + progressive CSV)
  - Phase 4: Regression Detection automation (4 scripts + CI integration)

- **Test Execution Strategies**
  - Unit tests: All services with mock dependencies
  - Integration tests: RAG service with real PostgreSQL + Qdrant + Embedding
  - Load tests: Locust-based progressive load (1 → 100 concurrent users)
  - Regression detection: Automated comparison with baseline metrics
